Getting start with Pokeman project

Solution Structure 

- API project -> Logical layer for any front end(s) we may have.
- MVC project -> Sample front end to pull data from API
- Database project -> A easy way to deploy database schema in other enviroments. 
- Hydra project -> This is a helper project so we don't have to duplicate code. For example, any models we have in the API we would need to duplicate across all frontends. If the hydra class is packaged we can ship it out easily.

Dev Notes

- I was on the fence if I should create a helper project (NuGet Package) for this exercise. Since we want production level code, I decided to go for it. Hopefully it's not overkill! 
- I normally would use autentication between my backend & frontends (normally leveraging Azure AD or AD B2C).
